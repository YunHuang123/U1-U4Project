XXX - object name (ship 1)
constructor - 3 parameters that initiate the length, width, and height of a ship
constructor - 0 parameters that assign the length, width, and height of the ship. This is a backup, just in case the user can’t think of the right password for any of the ships.

Public static boolean shipOnePw (String password) - the program takes the user input and checks to see if it’s a palindrome, if it is, returns true, else it returns false.

public static boolean shipTwoPw (String password) - gives a riddle and returns true if the user inputs the correct answer and returns false otherwise.

public static boolean shipThreePw (String password - gives an easier riddle and returns true if the user inputs the correct answer and false otherwise.

public void increaseLength () - increases the length by 50
public void increaseWidth () - increases the width by 5
public void increaseHeight () - increases the height by 50

public boolean willSurvivTsunami () - returns true if length is at least 300, width is at least 30, and height is at least 200, else returns false

public String adventureOne (int path) - returns what happens to the user that corresponds to his input.
public String adventureTwo (int path) - returns what happens to the user that corresponds to his input.
public String adventureThree (int path) - returns what happens to the user that corresponds to his input.
public String adventureFour (int path) - returns what happens to the user that corresponds to his input.
public String adventureFive (int path) - returns what happens to the user that corresponds to his input.
Different things can happen on the ocean, things like tsunami, pirate attack, hits a large rock, motion sickness, small waves, loneliness, etc

public String toString () - returns the length, width, and height of the ship unlocked.

public boolean endGame () - returns true if the user inputs 99, false otherwise


Client class:
Uses a scanner to receive user input.
Create four objects, then use if statements to print out the toString method if the password is right. Make sure the toString method is inside the if condition.
After a ship is unlocked, the user starts their journey.
Use user inputs to receive their choices on which path to go on.
If they choose the right path, they survive that round and continue until they either die or reach land.
Lastly, congrat the user.
